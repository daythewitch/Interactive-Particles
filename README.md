# **Interactive-Particles**
Interactive Star Animation using Particles.js



## **What is it:**

- Colorful stars drift around at random in the background of your website, and are pushed away when close to your cursor.
- **Customize Particle Settings:** You can adjust the particle count, shape, size, color, and interactivity in the JavaScript.
- Full HTML file is provided, + a copy and pastable snippet to insert into pre-existing HTML (you can paste it anywhere in the code and it should work)
- **Include JavaScript Library**: Load the Particles.js library by adding this script:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/particles.js/2.0.0/particles.min.js"></script>
